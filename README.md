# RoboArmHub
A UI interface for a centralized hub that controls and executes projects using KUKA (RA10) and Yaskawa (YRC1000) robot arms, streamlining robot programming and workflow automation; please note that all backend processes for this project are set to private.

## Project Overview
This project features a frontend interface for controlling a robot tasked with palletizing operations. It communicates with a backend program developed using FastAPI, which handles the logic and execution of tasks via REST APIs.

### Key Features
#### AI Integration 
Utilizes an AI algorithm that automatically determines the optimal placement of boxes based on their dimensions, enhancing efficiency and space utilization.

#### Developer Focus
This project emphasizes streamlining various stacking procedures into a centralized hub that can be controlled by both robot arms. All efforts are directed toward the development of the user interface, operational procedures, and robot arm controls.
